## DEMO OF THE ETL PROCESS 


## Advantages

1.Improved data quality.

2.Better data integration.

3.Increased data security.

4.Improved scalability




## Features

•	Data extraction from a wide range of sources such as databases, spreadsheets, APIs, and cloud storage.

•	Data transformation tasks such as cleansing, filtering, aggregating, and enriching data.

•	Intuitive interfaces for designing data integration workflows.




## Challenges

•	Potential complexity of data transformations. Transformations of large datasets can be time-consuming and complex.

•	Unhealthy data. Data is often messy and full of errors; ETL testing needs clean, accurate data to have healthy results.

•	Resource intensiveness.

•	Unavailability of inclusive test bed at times.

•	Lack of proper flow of business information.

## OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT : 
ETL allows businesses to consolidate data from multiple databases and other sources into a single repository with data that has been properly formatted and qualified in preparation for analysis.
This unified data repository allows for simplified access for analysis and additional processing. 
It also provides a single source of truth, ensuring that all enterprise data is consistent and up-to-date.
