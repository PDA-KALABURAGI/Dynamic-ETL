# Dynamic ETL

ETL(Extract, Transform and Load) is a process that extracts the data from different source systems, then transforms the data and finally loads the data into the data warehouse system.




## Advantages

1.Improved data quality.

2.Better data integration.

3.Increased data security.

4.Improved scalability




## Features

•	Data extraction from a wide range of sources such as databases, spreadsheets, APIs, and cloud storage.

•	Data transformation tasks such as cleansing, filtering, aggregating, and enriching data.

•	Intuitive interfaces for designing data integration workflows.




## Challenges

•	Potential complexity of data transformations. Transformations of large datasets can be time-consuming and complex.

•	Unhealthy data. Data is often messy and full of errors; ETL testing needs clean, accurate data to have healthy results.

•	Resource intensiveness.

•	Unavailability of inclusive test bed at times.

•	Lack of proper flow of business information.
